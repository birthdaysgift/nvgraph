Glossary:
    "RC" stands for [r]egular [c]ommit
    "MC" stands for [m]erge [c]ommit
    "CC" stands for [c]urrent [c]ommit
    "BC" stands for [b]ranch commit (commit where one or branches were started)
    "find_column()" should find leftmost available column
    "free_column(col)" frees column so it can be get via next call of find_column()
    "case" statement which evaluates its condition
           and prevents other cases to be executed
           once first is evaluated as True
